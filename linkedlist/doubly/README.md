## Introduction
With Linked Lists, items are stored in a chain of cells that donâ€™t need to be at sequential memory addresses (as it is in arrays). Memory for each cell is allocated as needed. Each cell has a pointer indicating the address of the next cell in the chain. A cell with an empty pointer marks the end of the chain.
