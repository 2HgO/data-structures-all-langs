## Introduction
Doubly Linked Lists (DLL) are an extension of Singly Linked Lists with one main difference: Each of its nodes contains a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node. As you know from [here]() Singly Linked List (SLL) nodes only  contains pointers to  the next  node; this means that SLLs can only be traversed forward i.e. we cannot go back to a previous node if required <sup></sup>. 

The double pointers contained by each node in a DLL, makes it **bi-directional**. We can traverse both forward and backward.

## Internals
Because of the extra pointer, DLLs use more space than SLLs.
