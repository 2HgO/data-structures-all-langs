## Introduction
With Doubly Linked Lists (DLLs), items are stored in a chain of cells that donâ€™t need to be at sequential memory addresses (as it is in arrays). Memory for each cell is allocated as needed. 

Each cell has two pointers: one indicates the address of the **previous cell** in the chain, and the other indicates the address of the **next cell** in the chain. A cell with an empty previous pointer marks the beginning of the chain while a cell with an empty next pointer marks end of the chain. 

The double pointers contained by each node in a DLL (as described in the previous paragraph) makes it **bi-directional**; We can traverse both forward and backward. This is the main difference between a DLL and a [Singly Linked List]() which can only be traversed in one direction: forward. Some operations on a DLL include:
* `addFirst(e)`: Add item to the front of the list
* `addLast(e)`: Add item to the back of the list
* `addAtPosition(n, e)`: Add item at specific position **n** in the list
* `removeFirst()`: Remove item from front of the list
* `removeLast()`: Remove item at the end of the list
* `removeAtPosition(n)`: Remove item at specific position **n** in the list

## Internals
Each element in a DLL is wrapped by a node. A single node contains data, a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node - because of the extra pointer, DLLs use more space that SLLs. The first node in the linkedlist is called the **head** and the last node is called the **tail**.

DLLs can be used to implement **Stacks**, **Lists** and **Queues**<sup>.

1. How does adding an item to the front (`addFirst(e)`) of a singly linkedlist work?
    a. Create new node to wrap element **e** 
    b. Set the new node's **next** pointer to the current head, if current head exists
    c. Set the current head's **previous** pointer to new node, if current head exists
    d. Set new node as head
