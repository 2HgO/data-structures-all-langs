## Introduction
With Doubly Linked Lists (DLLs), items are stored in a chain of cells that donâ€™t need to be at sequential memory addresses (as it is in arrays). Memory for each cell is allocated as needed. 

Each cell has two pointers: one indicates the address of the **previous cell** in the chain, and the other indicates the address of the **next cell** in the chain. A cell with an empty previous pointer marks the beginning of the chain while a cell with an empty next pointer marks end of the chain. 

The double pointers contained by each node in a DLL (as described in the previous paragraph) makes it **bi-directional**; We can traverse both forward and backward. This is the main difference between a DLL and a [Singly Linked List]() which can only be traversed in one direction: forward. Some operations on a DLL include:
* `addFirst(e)`: Add item to the front of the list
* `addLast(e)`: Add item to the back of the list
* `addAtPosition(n, e)`: Add item at specific position **n** in the list
* `removeFirst()`: Remove item from front of the list
* `removeLast()`: Remove item at the end of the list
* `removeAtPosition(n)`: Remove item at specific position **n** in the list

## Internals
Each element in a DLL is wrapped by a node. A single node contains data, a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node - because of the extra pointer, DLLs use more space that SLLs. The first node in the linkedlist is called the **head** and the last node is called the **tail**.

DLLs can be used to implement **Stacks**, **Lists** and **Queues**<sup>.

### Operations' Details
1. How does adding an item to the front (`addFirst(e)`) of a DLL work?
    - Create new node to wrap element **e** 
    - Set the new node's **next** pointer to the current head, if current head exists
    - Set the current head's **previous** pointer to new node, if current head exists
    - Set new node as head

2. How does adding an item to the back (`addLast(e)` of a DLL work?
    - Get stored tail node reference
    - Create a new node to wrap element **e** 
    - Set the current tail node's **next** pointer to the new node
    - Set the new node's **previous** pointer to current tail node
    - Set new node as tail

3. How does adding an item to a specific position (`addAtPosition(n, e)`) in a DLL work?
    - Starting at head node, traverse the linkedlist until position **n** is reached.
    - Create a new node to wrap element **e** 
    - Follow the insertion step for the condition that applies:
        * If there will be no node preceding the new node at position **n**, it means new node is the new head. Therefore, follow steps to `addFirst(e)` above
        * If there will be a preceding node and a following node for the new node at position **n**, then:
            - Set the preceding node's **next** pointer to the new node
            - Set new node's **previous** pointer to the preceding node
            - Set the following node's **previous** pointer  to the new node
            - Set the new node's **next** pointer to the following node
        ##### PS: It is not possible to get a condition to `addLast(e)` here because technically that position does not exist yet. To add element to back of the list, call `addLast(e)` directly.

4. How does removing an item from the front (`removeFirst()`) of a DLL work?
    - If current head is the only node in the DLL, then set head to null
    - Else,
        - Let's call current head's next node newHead (because it will be the new head node)
        - Set current head's **next** pointer to null
        - Set newHead's **previous** pointer to null
        - Set newHead as head

5. How does removing an item from the back (`removeLast()`) of a DLL work?
    - Get stored tail node reference
    - If tail node is the only node in the DLL, then set tail to null & head to null (because head == tail here)
    - Else,
        - Let's call current tails's previous node newTail (because it will be the new tail node)
        - Set current tail's **previous** pointer to null
        - Set newTail's **next** pointer to null
        - Set newTail as tail

6. How does removing an item from a specific position (`removeAtPosition(n)`) in an SLL work?
    - Starting at head node, traverse the DLL until position **n** is reached
    - Follow the removal step for the condition that applies:
        * If node to be removed is the head, call `removeFirst()` above
        * If node to be removed is the tail, call `removeLast()` above
        * If node is a middle node (i.e. is has both previous and next nodes), then
            * Set the previous node's **next** pointer to the next node
            * Set the next node's **previous** pointer to the previous node
            ##### PS: Following these steps ensures that nothing references the node to be removed, and that it will be garbage collected

## Time Complexity
