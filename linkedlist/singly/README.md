## Introduction
With Linked Lists, items are stored in a chain of cells that donâ€™t need to be at sequential memory addresses (as it is in arrays). Memory for each cell is allocated as needed. Each cell has a pointer indicating the address of the next cell in the chain. A cell with an empty pointer marks the end of the chain.<sup>[1](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/add-list-impl/linkedlist/singly#references)</sup>

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is **unidirectional**, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail)<sup>[2](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/add-list-impl/linkedlist/singly#references)</sup>. Some operations on a singly linked list include:
* `addFirst(node)`: Add item to the front of the list
* `addLast(node)`: Add item to the back of the list
* `addAtPosition(n, node)`: Add item at specific position **n** in the list
* `removeFirst()`: Remove item from front of the list
* `removeLast()`: Remove item at the end of the list
* `removeAtPosition(n)`: Remove item at specific position **n** in the list

## Internals
Each element in a linked list is a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node. The first node in the linkedlist is called the **head** and the last node is called the **tail**.<sup>[2](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/add-list-impl/linkedlist/singly#references)</sup>.

Linkedlists can be used to implement **Stacks**, **Lists** and **Queues**.<sup>[1](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/add-list-impl/linkedlist/singly#references)</sup>

How does adding an item to the front (`addFirst(node)`) of a singly linkedlist work?

How does removing an item from the front (`removeFirst()`) of a singly linkedlist work?
How does removing an item from the back (`removeLast()`) of a singly linkedlist work?
How does removing an item from a specific position (`removeAtPosition(n)`) in a singly linkedlist work?
