## Introduction
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices and edges that link these vertices. A graph can be represented by the symbol **G(V,E)**, where V = vertices and E = edges.

Graphs are used to solve real-world problems that involve the representation of the problem space as a network e.g. telephone network, social networks, neural networks and so on. In the case of a social network, users can be represented as vertices and friendship between users can be represented using edges. You can generalize this examples to the other problems a graph can model.

There are two types of graphs: **Directed** and **Undirected**.

### Directed Graphs
In a directed graph, nodes are connected by directed edges – they only go in one direction. For example, if an edge connects node 1 and 2, but the arrow head points towards 2, we can only traverse from node 1 to node 2 – not in the opposite direction<sup>[1]()</sup>.
