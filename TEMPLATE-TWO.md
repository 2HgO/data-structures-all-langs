## Introduction
Introduce the data structure here. List the operations that will be considered.

## Internals
Small description to explain what this section entails for the data structure in question.

### Structure 1 as underlying data structure

#### `firstOperation()`
Pseudocode for operation
    * Step 1
    * Step 2
    * Step 3

**Complexity Analysis**
Time Complexity: small description of what is involved
| Sample operation       | Worst Case for `firstOperation()`  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Constant Time/O(1)     | Constant Time/O(1)                 |

Space Complexity: small description of what is involved
| Sample operation       | Worst Case for `firstOperation()`  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Constant Space/O(1)     | Constant Space/O(1)               |
