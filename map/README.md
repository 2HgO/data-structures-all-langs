## Introduction

The *Map* is used to store mappings between two objects: a key and value pair. When you query a map with a key, you should get its associated value.

Some important operations for a map include:
* put(key, value) - add a key-value mapping to the map
* delete(key) - remove a key and it's associated value from the map
* get(key) - retrieve the associated value of a key from the map
