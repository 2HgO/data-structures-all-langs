# Data-structures-all-langs
A repository that contains explanations and (custom) implementations of the most popular data structure in various languages

# The Goal
Hi friend, welcome ðŸŽ‰.

This simple goal of this project is to help people understand the internals of the most popular data structures. It is my hope that by reading the README's for each structure as well as looking through various implementations, the people who make the time to visit this repo will gain an intuitive understanding.
